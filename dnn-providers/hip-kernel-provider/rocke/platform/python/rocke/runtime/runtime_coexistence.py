"""Which ROCm runtime do we bind to -- and whose?

Both the HIP (`hip_module`) and comgr (`comgr`) ctypes wrappers must
resolve the *same* loaded runtime instance. The crux is process-level
coexistence with a host that may already own a ROCm runtime:

    A ROCm PyTorch wheel bundles ``libamdhip64.so`` / ``libamd_comgr.so``
    inside ``torch/lib`` and, as a side effect of ``import torch``, loads
    them into the process. A *second* copy of HIP loaded by rocke from
    ``/opt/rocm`` is a **different runtime instance** with disjoint state
    -- a module loaded via one is invisible to ``hipModuleGetFunction``
    from the other, surfacing as ``hipError(500) named symbol not found``
    even when the HSACO is well-formed. This is a loader / runtime-instance
    phenomenon (two separate HSA runtime inits, two handle tables), not a
    context-binding one.

So when torch is already in the process we prefer *its* bundled ``.so``,
sharing one loaded HIP/comgr runtime instance across both halves of the
process. A library must never ``import torch`` merely to obtain that side
effect (it would invert the dependency and drag a multi-hundred-MB wheel
into a pure-IR process): we only honor a torch that is *already* imported
(via :data:`sys.modules`) and otherwise discover a real ROCm install
directly. The sole sanctioned exception is the explicit
:func:`rocke.runtime.comgr.prefer_bundled_lib` entrypoint hook, which
imports torch deliberately to pin the bundled comgr before lowering.

This module owns only *resolution* -- candidate path discovery + the
Windows DLL-directory registration. The actual ``dlopen`` (per-family
``_load_lib``), the HIP primary-context binding (``_ensure_hip_init``),
and device-property introspection (``get_device_arch``) live with their
respective runtime wrappers.
